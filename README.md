# First Project for Virtual Worlds 2025

This is my first official project using Unity. I don't really have any game design / development experience, but this was an assignment for my Building Virtual Worlds class where we had to build a world, add interactions, and add transitions. 
My world is a simple restaurant in the middle of nowhere, partially inspired by the Boar Hat in the anime Seven Deadly Sins, which is why it’s managed by an origami pig who slightly resembles Hawk.  It has an odd menu of Burgers, Beer, and Bananas. You can walk around, "interact" with customers, "eat" and "drink" and transition to different scenes.
